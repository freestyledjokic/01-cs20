                <p>According to the Sports & Fitness Industry Association, tennis is one of the fastest growing sports in the United States and has attracted attention from big names in other sports such as LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Tom Brady. Pickleball was invented in the mid-1960s by Joel Pritchard, a former congressman from Washington state, and two of his friends. The sport is named after Pritchard's dog, Pickles, who would chase the ball around during their games.</p>
                <p>In the 1970s, the sport began to gain popularity in the United States and Canada, and the first official pickleball tournament was held in Seattle, Washington in 1984. Since then, the sport has continued to grow in popularity, with the formation of the USA Pickleball Association (USAPA) in 2005, which is the governing body for the sport in the United States. Today, pickleball is played in all 50 states and in many countries around the world.</p>
